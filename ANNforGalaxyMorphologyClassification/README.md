# Description

This repo contains most of the work I did during my master's thesis project. The main goal was to develop a classifier for galaxy morphology and as seconday objectives, I wanted to learn python and artificial neural networks, hence, I choose that programming language and that machine learning technique. In order to maximize the ingisht gained, I didn't take advantage of any machine learning library such as scikit-learn. I programmed everything needed to train and test an aritificial neural network.
